This example demonstrates an uncommon error in F# related to mutable variables.  In F#, variables are immutable by default, promoting safer code.  However, when using mutable variables (declared with `let mutable`), it's crucial to understand that expressions involving them are evaluated at the time of assignment and not reevaluated when the mutable variable's value changes.  This can lead to unexpected results when one anticipates a recalculation after modifying a mutable variable used within an expression. The solution shows a common approach to handle this situation, involving functions and recalculation as needed.
